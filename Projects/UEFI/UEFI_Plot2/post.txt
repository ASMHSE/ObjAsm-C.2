Hi all!

I'm developing [color=blue][b]Plot2UEFI[/b][/color] application.

This little UEFI application show a simplified Steer Growing Simulation, like an excuse. But you can see that if you want in [url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328416533_Deposicion_en_novillos_en_crecimiento_modelo_de_Di_Marco_et_al_1989_4_Calibracion_con_el_nuevo_novillo_de_referencia]Resarch Gate[/url] .

In this development the components used are:

[b]PixelUEFI[/b]

    An adaptation of Pixelmap.inc, just a little part and added some extensions. 

[b]CharsUEFI[/b]

    Extend PixelUEFI to draw a font, because without an OS you have not graphical fonts. Perhaps you can retrieve the text font, but I don't know.

[b]GraphicUEFI[/b]

    An XYplot that show lines (only one is used, then others were erased form source code). 

[b]IntegAsm32 Core and Test modulus[/b]

    This can make numerical integration for simulations using several methods: Timestep, Runge-Kutta, Fehlberg and Kash-Carp.

[i]Note:[/i]

    There is some "feature" in Virtual Box and filling the background hang up, but in real UEFI is necessary to fill the background. Then there are 2 binaries attached. If somebody know about this problem, thanks in advance.

Obviously, to build the application you need ObjAsm with UEFI support, SmplMath and MReal macros.
